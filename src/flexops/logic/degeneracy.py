"""Manual parallel-train degeneracy handling: hierarchy over a declared group.

Symmetry among identical parallel trains (RO skids, pumps, batteries, ...)
creates solver-time degeneracy: many equal-objective solutions differ only in
*which* interchangeable unit is on, or in how a shared duty is split between
them. A unit cannot see its siblings, so this is handled **outside the unit
level**, as a transform a caller applies explicitly to a group of units it has
declared -- never inside a unit's ``build()``.

:func:`register_parallel_group` is that transform. The caller lists the group
in priority order and it is ordered **descending** along that list::

    group[0].status[t] >= group[1].status[t] >= ... >= group[-1].status[t]

so a train may not run unless its predecessor runs, and the first-listed unit
is the first one on. The same ordering is applied to any continuous Vars the
caller names, which rules out the *permuted copies* of a split duty: three RO
trains free to trade recovery among themselves reach the same cost under any
relabelling, and the ordering admits exactly one of those labellings. What that
buys is a smaller search -- symmetric branches are cut -- not a unique split:
an equal-cost split that is not merely a relabelling of another still satisfies
the ordering.

Status ordering is the default and needs a ``status`` Var on every unit. A group
whose units carry none -- a tank, or any unit the caller never applied
:func:`~flexops.logic.status.add_status` to -- is registered with
``order_status=False``, which orders the named variables alone.

    """Declare units as a parallel/degenerate hierarchy group and order them.

    For units the caller knows to be interchangeable or otherwise
    hierarchically related — parallel skids, staged trains, a lead/lag pair.

    **Canonical direction.** ``units`` is given in priority order, lowest
    first, and the group is ordered *descending* along that list::

        units[0].status[t] >= units[1].status[t] >= ... >= units[-1].status[t]

    so a train may not run unless its predecessor runs and ``units[0]`` is the
    first one on. Pass ``order_status=False`` to skip this and order only the
    named ``variables`` -- the way to register a group whose units carry no
    ``status`` Var. Implemented by chaining
    :func:`~flexops.logic.conditional.add_conditional` over every consecutive
    pair *back to front* (``add_conditional(units[i + 1], units[i])`` reads as
    "``units[i + 1]`` on implies ``units[i]`` on"), reusing its tested two-unit
    implication semantics rather than re-implementing them. Each pair's
    Constraint therefore lands on the **later** unit: ``units[0]`` carries no
    ``conditional``, ``units[-1]`` does.

    **Continuous variables.** Each name in ``variables`` is resolved on every
    unit and ordered the same way, ``units[i].<name> >= units[i + 1].<name>``,
    as a Constraint named ``{name}_ordering`` attached beside that pair's
    ``conditional``. Time-indexed Vars are ordered at every index; scalar Vars
    (a unit's regressable process parameters, e.g. ``ReverseOsmosis.recovery``)
    get a single Constraint. Such parameters are *fixed* at construction, so an
    ordering over them only binds once a caller or FlexParameterize unfixes
    them — until then it is a trivially satisfied constant.

    Args:
        units: >= 2 units, in the intended canonical order (highest priority
            first).
        variables: Local component names of continuous Vars to order across the
            group, as each unit exposes them -- a renaming unit exposes the
            renamed name. One name is resolved on every unit and chained over
            the whole group, ``units[0].<name> >= units[1].<name> >= ...``.
            Empty by default.
        order_status: Whether to order the group's ``status`` Vars (default
            True). Pass False for a group whose units carry no ``status`` Var,
            or to leave the on/off order free and canonicalize only
            ``variables``.

    Returns:
        The ``len(units) - 1`` attached ``conditional`` Constraints, one per
        consecutive pair, in order -- empty when ``order_status`` is False. Any
        ``variables`` Constraints are reachable on the units as
        ``{name}_ordering``.
